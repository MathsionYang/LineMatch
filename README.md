This is a college student innovation and entrepreneurship project, but unfortunately, due to the team's reasons, we can't finish it. But maybe you can find some useful things, such as: use lsd algorithm to complete line detection, or Hough transform; there are also some pictures for training, if you are interested, you can try it, welcome push.
